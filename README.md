# GANerAid

- **GANerAid** is an open‑source Python library for generating realistic synthetic tabular data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).                 
- I am a contributor and part of the GANerAid team, working on improving the library and supporting its application in synthetic data generation workflows.       
- It is designed to help create high‑quality synthetic patient data that preserves the statistical properties of real clinical datasets while ensuring anonymity and privacy.[GANerAid](https://github.com/TeamGenerAid/GANerAid)

## 🚀 Overview

In many fields — especially clinical research — collecting and sharing patient data is expensive and restricted due to privacy laws. GANerAid tackles this challenge by using a neural network model that generates synthetic data with similar distributions and variable correlations as the real dataset, enabling safe data augmentation, analysis, and experimentation without compromising sensitive information. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

GANerAid uses Generative Adversarial Networks, specifically tailored for tabular data, to produce synthetic samples suitable for small‑sized datasets and clinical trial workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧠 Key Features

- 💡 **Generative Adversarial Architecture**  
  Uses a GAN model adapted for tabular data to generate synthetic samples.

- 📊 **Preserves Statistical Properties**  
  Ensures that generated data maintains distributions and correlations similar to the original dataset. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- 🩺 **Applicable to Clinical Data**  
  Designed for real‑world use in clinical trials, medical research, and similar applications.

- 🔄 **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
  Supports preparation, augmentation, and evaluation of datasets.

- 📈 **Evaluation Tools**  
  Built‑in functions to assess distribution similarity and data quality between real and synthesized data.

## 🧪 Example Uses

- Generating additional patient records for analysis or model training.
- Protecting sensitive medical data while enabling research use.
- Testing data workflows without needing access to proprietary datasets.
